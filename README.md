**ChromaSweep: A Fast and Accurate Color Space Conversion Library**
=================================================================

ChromaSweep is a TypeScript library designed to provide fast and accurate color space conversions for various applications, including image processing, computer vision, and graphics rendering. Our library aims to bridge the gap between different color spaces, enabling developers to seamlessly work with various color formats and achieve precise color representation.

The primary purpose of ChromaSweep is to provide a robust and efficient solution for color space conversions, addressing the limitations of existing libraries and tools. Our library supports a wide range of color spaces, including RGB, YUV, YCbCr, HSV, and more, making it an ideal choice for developers working with diverse color formats. With ChromaSweep, you can easily convert between different color spaces, ensuring accurate color representation and minimizing potential errors.

One of the key benefits of ChromaSweep is its performance. Our library is optimized for speed, leveraging advanced algorithms and techniques to perform color space conversions quickly and efficiently. This makes it suitable for real-time applications, such as video processing and computer vision. Additionally, ChromaSweep is highly configurable, allowing developers to customize the conversion process according to their specific requirements.
